    <hr>
    <p>This is Sai Maneesha. I have done my B.tech in the stream of Computer Science Engineering.
        <br>
         I am known for my communication skills. I previously worked as IT recruiter for 2.8 years.
        <br>
        I had to take a break from my careeer as I was focused on being a full time mother.
        <br> 
       I'm currently learning Full Stack Development and would like continue my career in IT industry as I'm from CSE background.
       <br>
       My career objective is to work with an organization that provides me with a challenging environment and ample opportunities 
       <br> to apply my professional, innovative skills and henceforth work for the exponential growth of the company.
